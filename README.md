## Introduction
This is a VST3/AU OTT-style compressor plugin made with [JUCE](https://juce.com/). OTT stands for Over-The-Top, it is a very aggressive dynamic effect that combines upward compression (raises the level of quieter sounds, making them louder) and downward compression (lowers the level of louder sounds, limiting the peaks). This combination results in a dense, loud and harmonically rich sound; check the demo below to hear some practical examples.

--- THERE WILL BE A VIDEO LINK HERE WHEN THE DEMO IS READY ---

The original OTT compressor was developed in Ableton Live's Multiband Dynamics and Xfer Records replicated this effect in a [free plugin](https://splice.com/plugins/3788-ott-vst-au-by-xfer-records). My plugin is simply a curious attempt to recreate this chain of processes and give it my own spin.

## Inner Processing
I will update this section with a diagram of the DSP once it is done...
